Feel free to improve this project yourself, clone the repo, branch from master, create some changes then create a PR with these changes.

# Tests

I've added phpunit for testing that the basic logic is all still working. To run the tests on Windows:

In the root of the repo run
`php ./tests/phpunit tests/`

For linux/mac, In the root of the repo run 
`./tests/phpunit tests/`
